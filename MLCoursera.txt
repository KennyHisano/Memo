===========================
Linear Regression
===========================
Mean normalization

xi with xi - ui to make approximately zero mean
{mean normalization = average of elements/ (max- min)}
x1 = size-average/all
ex -0.5 < x1 < 0.5


:polynomial regression
00 + 01x + 02x^2 + 03x^3
known as cubic model

root for farther elements
